### Technical Proposal for Improvements

1. **SEO Improvements:**

   - Optimize meta tags, including title tags and meta descriptions, to be more descriptive and keyword-rich for SEO purposes.

2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Develop a backend system to manage inventory, user accounts, and orders, providing a fully functional e-commerce experience.
   - Implement secure user authentication and authorization for personalized user experiences, such as wishlist creation and viewing purchase history.

3. **Mobile App Development:**
   - Considering the increasing trend of mobile usage, developing a mobile application for iOS and Android could extend the reach and accessibility of the Nike Sneakers Store.

By addressing these areas for improvement, the project can significantly enhance performance, accessibility, user engagement, and overall user satisfaction, paving the way for a more successful and comprehensive online presence for the Nike Sneakers Store.
